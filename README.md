**DRUGS? YOU BETTER KNOW**


It’s no secret that drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, dance clubs or raves.
Quite simply, people do it because it can enhance their experience. But we’re not here to justify, give reasons or explain why people do it.  It’s a fact.
Drug use exists, and there’s the urgent need to make it happen in the most safe way possible.
We take for granted that festival organizers know that drugs will get onto the site, so we believe it's a responsibility to make sure people remain safe. Denying the issue just causes fatalities.

“Festivals attract a wide array of people not experienced with party drugs. Relying on strangers inside to purchase drugs is a risk factor for purchasing adulterated products. Fear of security/police at festivals leads to risky drug-taking such as ingesting one’s full batch of drugs at the entrance. These risks are compounded by environmental factors including crowding, hot temperature, and lack of water and inadequate medical emergency response.”

We want to help people to make informed and responsible choices, raising awareness about substances in circulation and reducing the chance of drug-related problems.

We hope for a local music policy that doesn’t deny the use of drugs but aims for harm reduction advice and support by showing how to do it safely, giving a non-judgmental service, accessible and available to all.


**What are drugs? **
Drugs are natural or artificial substances that can alter perception of reality, modify the level of consciousness, effect on psychophysical capacity and can easily become addictive. The substances reach the brain through the bloodstream, crossing the blood-brain barrier, promoting or inhibiting the reuptake of certain neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline at the synapse.
 Psychoactive substances can be divided into several categories: stimulants, psychedelics, downers, empathogens/entactogens and dissociatives.
